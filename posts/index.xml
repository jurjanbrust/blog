I am surprised at the possibilities this offers. So let&amp;rsquo;s dive into this and use WSL 2 and Docker-Compose to fire up some containers to present sensor data in a Grafana dashboard.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Leverage the power of Azure</title><link>https://jurjan.info/posts/powerplatform/excel2pdf/</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 Sep 2020 09:56:18 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://jurjan.info/posts/powerplatform/excel2pdf/</guid><description>&lt;p>Combine the power of azure functions within PowerAutomate for unprecedented possibilities.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Power Automate</title><link>https://jurjan.info/posts/powerplatform/listitem2pdf/</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 Sep 2020 17:00:35 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://jurjan.info/posts/powerplatform/listitem2pdf/</guid><description>&lt;p>Create a PDF file from a SharePoint list item using the no-code Microsoft Power Automate Platform.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>LoRaWAN</title><link>https://jurjan.info/posts/iot/lorawan/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 May 2020 18:47:42 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://jurjan.info/posts/iot/lorawan/</guid><description>&lt;p>In this post I will do a write-up of my current project: having fun with LoRaWAN.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Superheroes</title><link>https://jurjan.info/posts/programming/angularjs/superheroes/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Apr 2020 19:34:20 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://jurjan.info/posts/programming/angularjs/superheroes/</guid><description>&lt;p>Want to get started developing AngularJS / TypeScript applications using Visual Studio Code?

Also for system administrators PowerShell can be a great solution for various tasks. There are little things that cannot be done using PowerShell when you would compare it to for example an executable file. Microsoft made some security measures to protect you from running any malicious PowerShell scripts and in this article I will summarise the information I found regarding this topic.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Migrating large corporate SharePoint intranets</title><link>https://jurjan.info/posts/sharepoint/migration/i.approach/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Nov 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jurjan.info/posts/sharepoint/migration/i.approach/</guid><description>Approach (part I of IV) Analysis (part II of IV) Migration (part III of IV) Verification (part IV of IV) This is a multi-page blog-posts about my experiences with SharePoint migrations. You can navigate between the four different pages by clicking on the hyperlinks above. In this series I will describe the migration-strategy I used and hopefully it will give you a guideline to use in your own SharePoint migrations.</description></item><item><title>Migrating large corporate SharePoint intranets</title><link>https://jurjan.info/posts/sharepoint/migration/ii.analysis/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Nov 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jurjan.info/posts/sharepoint/migration/ii.analysis/</guid><description>Approach (part I of IV) Analysis (part II of IV) Migration (part III of IV) Verification (part IV of IV) Analysis Your most valuable resource for information about the to-be-migrated environment will be the users itself. Getting to know who is working on the SharePoint site and how they are using it is vital for your analysis. Also use the opportunity to give insights about your migration strategy. Your second most valuable tool will be to use scripting in order to analyse the environment.</description></item><item><title>Migrating large corporate SharePoint intranets</title><link>https://jurjan.info/posts/sharepoint/migration/iii.migrate/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Nov 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jurjan.info/posts/sharepoint/migration/iii.migrate/</guid><description>Approach (part I of IV) Analysis (part II of IV) Migration (part III of IV) Verification (part IV of IV) Migration In this third part of the series I will discuss the actual migration itself. If all previous steps were done right, the migration should be the easy part of the complete project.
Tool selection I have found that for migrations to work almost autonomous only three tools are needed:</description></item><item><title>Migrating large corporate SharePoint intranets</title><link>https://jurjan.info/posts/sharepoint/migration/iv.verification/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Nov 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jurjan.info/posts/sharepoint/migration/iv.verification/</guid><description>Approach (part I of IV) Analysis (part II of IV) Migration (part III of IV) Verification (part IV of IV) Verification For most of my migration projects I have used ShareGate very successfully as the primary migration tool. ShareGate has got quite excessive logging to get insights about the quality of the migration. But what if ShareGate logs that everything is fine, but when in fact it is not? To get better confidence about the quality of ShareGate (which is just fine in my opinion) I also developed a PowerShell script to check if all documents have been migrated.</description></item><item><title>SharePoint listdata generator</title><link>https://jurjan.info/posts/sharepoint/powershell/generatelistdata/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Sep 2019 14:38:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://jurjan.info/posts/sharepoint/powershell/generatelistdata/</guid><description>&lt;p>Testing your application with large numbers of data is important but sadly often forgotten.
