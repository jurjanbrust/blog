You can navigate between the four different pages by clicking on the hyperlinks above. In this series I will describe the migration-strategy I used and hopefully it will give you a guideline to use in your own SharePoint migrations.</description></item><item><title>Migrating large corporate SharePoint intranets</title><link>https://jurjan.info/posts/sharepoint/migration/ii.analysis/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Nov 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jurjan.info/posts/sharepoint/migration/ii.analysis/</guid><description>Approach (part I of IV) Analysis (part II of IV) Migration (part III of IV) Verification (part IV of IV) Analysis Your most valuable resource for information about the to-be-migrated environment will be the users itself. Getting to know who is working on the SharePoint site and how they are using it is vital for your analysis. Also use the opportunity to give insights about your migration strategy. Your second most valuable tool will be to use scripting in order to analyse the environment.</description></item><item><title>Migrating large corporate SharePoint intranets</title><link>https://jurjan.info/posts/sharepoint/migration/iii.migrate/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Nov 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jurjan.info/posts/sharepoint/migration/iii.migrate/</guid><description>Approach (part I of IV) Analysis (part II of IV) Migration (part III of IV) Verification (part IV of IV) Migration In this third part of the series I will discuss the actual migration itself. If all previous steps were done right, the migration should be the easy part of the complete project.
Tool selection I have found that for migrations to work almost autonomous only three tools are needed:</description></item><item><title>Migrating large corporate SharePoint intranets</title><link>https://jurjan.info/posts/sharepoint/migration/iv.verification/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Nov 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jurjan.info/posts/sharepoint/migration/iv.verification/</guid><description>Approach (part I of IV) Analysis (part II of IV) Migration (part III of IV) Verification (part IV of IV) Verification For most of my migration projects I have used ShareGate very successfully as the primary migration tool. ShareGate has got quite excessive logging to get insights about the quality of the migration. But what if ShareGate logs that everything is fine, but when in fact it is not? To get better confidence about the quality of ShareGate (which is just fine in my opinion) I also developed a PowerShell script to check if all documents have been migrated.</description></item><item><title>SharePoint listdata generator</title><link>https://jurjan.info/posts/sharepoint/powershell/generatelistdata/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Sep 2019 14:38:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://jurjan.info/posts/sharepoint/powershell/generatelistdata/</guid><description>&lt;p>Testing your application with large numbers of data is important but sadly often forgotten.
